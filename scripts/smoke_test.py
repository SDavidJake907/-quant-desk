"""Pre-trade smoke test: verify the environment before any scan runs.

    python scripts/smoke_test.py              # paper mode: warn on problems
    python scripts/smoke_test.py --live       # live mode: hard-block on problems

Checks:
  1. Ollama is reachable and triage + embed models are installed
  2. Alpaca keys are configured and point to the PAPER endpoint
  3. Account is reachable and ACTIVE
  4. Daily-loss guard baseline (session start equity) is set

Exit non-zero on any failure. Safe to run before every scheduled scan; it
places no order and changes no position.
