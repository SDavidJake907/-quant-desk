"""One page: what this system did, and what needs a human.

    python scripts/hub.py                 # the briefing
    python scripts/hub.py --narrate       # + Gemma's read of it
    python scripts/hub.py --days 5        # widen the window

READ-ONLY, and outside the frozen trading path. It reads logs and asks the
broker for state. It places no order and changes no policy.

WHY THIS EXISTS
The state of this system is spread across a 300KB log, a JSONL audit trail, a
broker account, four scheduled tasks, a policy object and two markdown files.
Answering "is it working?" has repeatedly meant reading funnel lines by hand —
and twice this week it meant writing throwaway scripts, because a scan running
on stale bars and a market with nothing in it print the same line.

`report.py` assembles the EVIDENCE — every measurement the project has made.
`monitor.py` watches the account. This is the third thing: the OPERATIONAL
picture, today, in the order a human needs it.

THE MODEL NARRATES, IT DOES NOT COMPUTE
Every number here is arithmetic over logs, done in Python and printed whether
Ollama is up or not. `--narrate` adds a short prose read on top. The rule is
the same one the news layer runs under and for the same reason: the model's
output schema has no numeric fields, so a figure it invents cannot reach the
page. If the model is unreachable the briefing is unchanged — it simply has
no commentary.

IT DEGRADES RATHER THAN FAILS
A missing log, an unreachable broker and a dead model each cost their own
section and nothing else. A status tool that cannot run when something is
broken is a status tool that is useless exactly when it is needed.
