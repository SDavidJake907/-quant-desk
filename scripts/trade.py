"""Scan, size, and place bracket orders on a PAPER account.

    python scripts/trade.py                    # scan and print, send nothing
    python scripts/trade.py --submit-paper     # explicitly submit paper orders
    python scripts/trade.py --index all --show 20

Needs SCANNER_ALPACA_KEY_ID and SCANNER_ALPACA_SECRET_KEY in .env.

WHAT THIS DOES
    1. refuse to run if the market is closed, equity is low, the daily loss
       limit is hit, or too many positions are already open
    2. scan for setups that triggered in the last few bars
    3. skip anything already held or already ordered
    4. size each by risk, capped by position size and buying power
    5. send one bracket order per setup: limit entry, stop, target

LIVE TRADING IS NOT AVAILABLE HERE, BY DESIGN
There is no --live flag. This script talks to the paper endpoint only. Running
real money through this strategy is a decision to make deliberately, with your
own hand on the switch, against evidence that currently amounts to ~200 trades
from 86 days of data with a threshold chosen by looking at those same trades.

The honest use of this script is to accumulate OUT-OF-SAMPLE results: every
paper trade it takes is one the backtest did not pick its parameters from.
