"""Close positions the backtest would already have closed.

    python scripts/manage_positions.py                  # report only
    python scripts/manage_positions.py --execute        # actually close
    python scripts/manage_positions.py --max-bars 60

THE MISMATCH THIS FIXES
The backtest closed every trade after 60 bars — that is how +0.218R was
measured, and 5.6% of holdout trades exited on that rule rather than at a stop
or a target. A bracket order has no such limit. Without this, a filled position
rides indefinitely while the evidence justifying it assumed a ~4.6 session
maximum. Live results would then be measuring a strategy nobody tested.

Age is counted in BARS from the symbol's own series, not in calendar time,
because that is how the limit was defined. Weekends and holidays therefore
cost nothing, exactly as in the backtest.

It also cancels working orders whose trigger bar has aged out: a limit resting
at a price the setup no longer justifies is not the trade that was validated.
