"""Is there a tradeable run-up into earnings, exited well before the report?

    python scripts/test_preearnings.py --index sp500

THE TRADE
Enter N trading days before an earnings announcement, exit M days before it.
M is 4 or 5, so the position is closed well clear of the release and never
carries gap risk. This is the opposite of the live system's earnings gate,
which refuses anything inside 7 days — not a contradiction, a different trade.

WHERE THE DATES COME FROM
SEC EDGAR 8-K filings carrying item 2.02, "results of operations". That is the
actual announcement date as filed, not a scraped estimate, and it reaches back
about eight years. Yahoo's quoteSummary returns 401 and its chart earnings
events are empty, so this is the only honest source available here.

THE CONTROL IS THE POINT
The last two years were strongly up. "Buy 15 days before earnings" will show a
positive return in that tape whether or not earnings had anything to do with
it. So every window is paired with the SAME holding period started on random
dates in the same symbols. If the two match, there is no earnings effect —
only market drift, which you could have had by holding an index fund.
