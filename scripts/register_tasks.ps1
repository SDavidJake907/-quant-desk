#
# OFFSET BY THREE MINUTES, ON PURPOSE. Bars close on the hour and the half
# hour. A task firing at :00 races the data provider to finalise the bar it
# needs, and a run at exactly 05:30 reads YESTERDAY's bars because the first
# bar of the session does not close until 06:00. Starting at :33 means every
# scan reads a bar that closed three minutes earlier and is complete.
#
# A full run takes about 3.2 minutes with ten candidates — 26s to scan 501
# symbols, ~16s per candidate for news and triage, 9s to rank them all in one
# call — so the 30-minute window is not close to tight.

# 11:45 Alaska = 15:45 Eastern, fifteen minutes before the bell. Late enough
# that the day has had its chance, early enough that a market order fills and
# a failure still leaves time to close by hand.
#
# This is the only scheduled task that SUBMITS orders to close. It is not
# supervised by watchdog.py, which refuses order submission outright: a process
# that may have reached the broker and died before reading the response has
# unknown position state, and restarting it could sell twice. flatten.py is
# instead safe to re-run by hand, because an already-closed position counts as
# success.
#
# The wind-down that stops NEW positions from Thursday lives in TradingPolicy
# (wind_down_from_weekday) and is enforced by trade.py, not here — so a missed
# run of this task cannot also silently re-enable Thursday and Friday entries.
# EVERY WEEKDAY, FOUR TRIGGERS (2026-10-05). It used to be Fridays only, and
# when Friday is a market holiday the last session is Thursday: nothing
# flattened and positions rode a four-day close (FREEZE.md: 2026-12-24, 12-31,
# 2027-03-25, 06-17). flatten.py --only-before-closure asks the broker calendar
# for the NEXT session and acts only on the last session before a 3+ day
# closure, so on an ordinary Monday-Thursday every trigger exits doing nothing.

#
# --only-if-closing-within 25 picks the pair for the day's actual close. The
# retry re-runs the same idempotent job: flat already means nothing to do, and
# anything a first run could not close gets a second chance before the bell.
# Still not flat after the retry: flatten.py writes FLATTEN_ALERT.txt to the
