REM Off-hours data collection — this is what "ready and loaded with the correct
REM data" actually requires.
REM
REM Running the TRADER around the clock would not do it: trade.py exits within
REM seconds when the market is closed, and the bar cache is TTL-based, so an
REM idle process holds nothing warm. What keeps the system ready is history
REM that keeps growing while the market is shut.
REM
REM collect_intraday.py accumulates 30-minute bars past Yahoo's 60-day window.
REM That window is the hard ceiling on every backtest here, and it only lifts
REM by saving bars before they age out — which cannot be done retroactively.
