"""Re-arm open positions that have lost their protective stop.

    python scripts/protect.py              # report only, send nothing
    python scripts/protect.py --submit     # send the OCO orders

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
On 2026-08-07 every bracket was sent with `time_in_force="day"`. That applies
to the protective legs as well as the entry, so at 20:01 UTC — one minute
after the close — the broker cancelled all three stops and all three targets.
Nothing errored, because the orders had done exactly what `day` means.

Three positions worth 58,701 dollars then sat with no floor under them
through the weekend and all of Monday's session. A power outage had stopped
the scheduler, so nothing was even running to notice.

`bracket_payload` now sends `gtc`, which stops this happening to any NEW
order. It cannot help a position that is already naked — a bracket attaches
protection to an entry, and these entries filled days ago. That is what this
script is for: it reads the original stop and target back out of the audit
log and re-arms each position with a standalone OCO.

THE LEVELS COME FROM THE AUDIT LOG, NOT FROM TODAY'S PRICE
Re-deriving a stop from the current chart would silently move the exit, and
every R-multiple this project has recorded assumes the stop the setup was
sized against. `size_position` chose the share count FROM that stop distance,
so a different stop means the position is no longer risking what it was
built to risk. The log is the only record of the original number, so the log
is what this reads.

A BREACHED STOP IS CLOSED, NOT LEFT FOR A HUMAN (changed 2026-10-06)
It still never re-arms a stop the price has already traded through -- that
would sit above the market and fill instantly at a worse price. But it no
longer leaves such a position naked "for a human": on 2026-10-05 INTC sat
unprotected through the open that way. A breached stop or a reached target is
now sold at market (queued for the open if the market is shut -- what a stop
does on a gap), only for the naked shares, never twice, and an alert file is
written to the Desktop and logs/ for every action. See execution/protection.py.
