"""Which strategy owns each broker position, read from order history.

WHY THIS EXISTS (WORKLIST §37)
The weekend flatten closed EVERY position in the account and the hold-limit
closer closed ANY position older than 60 bars. Both were written when one
strategy traded here. With manual picks and the momentum engine in the same
account, a 3-month momentum hold would have been sold on its first Friday and
a manual pick bought on Tuesday the same week.

HOW OWNERSHIP IS KNOWN
Alpaca's position record does not name the order that opened it, but every
order this repo sends carries a prefixed client_order_id, and Alpaca keeps it.
The NEWEST FILLED BUY per symbol names the owner. Protective legs are sells, so
they never decide ownership; a position re-entered by a different strategy
belongs to whoever bought last.

A symbol with no prefixed buy is UNKNOWN: bought by hand in the Alpaca
dashboard, or from before prefixes existed. Unknown positions are never
closed by a rule written for a strategy -- whoever bought them owns the exit.

PURE. Nothing here reaches a broker.
