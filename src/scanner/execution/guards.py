"""The checks that run before any order is sent.

An automated system trades whatever edge it has, repeatedly and without
hesitation — including a negative one. These guards do not make a strategy
profitable; they bound how wrong it can go before a human looks at it.

Every guard here is a refusal, never an adjustment. A blocked order is
reported and skipped, not quietly resized into something the caller did not
ask for.
