"""Alpaca adapter: account state, and bracket orders built from setups.

PAPER IS THE DEFAULT AND LIVE IS DELIBERATELY AWKWARD
`paper=True` unless someone writes otherwise, and the live host is only
reachable by passing `paper=False` explicitly. There is no environment
variable that silently flips it, because the difference between the two is
whether losses are real.

WHY BRACKET ORDERS
A setup is three prices: entry, stop, target. Sent as one bracket, the broker
holds the stop and the target from the moment the entry fills, and cancels one
when the other triggers. Sent as three separate orders, there is a window in
which the position exists with no stop behind it — and if the process dies in
that window, the position stays naked until someone notices.

IDEMPOTENCY
Every order carries a `client_order_id` derived from the symbol and the
trigger bar's timestamp. Alpaca rejects a duplicate id, so a restart, a retry
or two scans of the same bar cannot open the same trade twice. This is the
cheapest protection against the worst bug an unattended trader can have.

    A LIMIT entry at the trigger close, not a market order. The backtest
    assumed a fill at that price; a market order would fill wherever the book
    happens to be and quietly break the correspondence.

    GTC, NOT DAY — THIS WAS A LIVE BUG
    `day` applies to the protective legs as well as the entry, so every stop
    and target CANCELLED AT THE CLOSE. Three positions went into a weekend
    naked, 59,186 dollars of exposure with no stop, and nothing reported an
    error because the orders had done exactly what `day` means.

    Only 54% of these setups resolve inside one session. The other half are
    held overnight by design, so roughly half of all positions were losing
    their protection every night while the backtest assumed a stop that was
    always live. An overnight gap has no floor under it.

    The cost of `gtc` is that an unfilled ENTRY also persists, and a limit
    resting for days could fill long after its setup went stale. `trade.py`
    cancels working entries older than the freshness window for that reason —
    a stale entry we control beats a naked position we do not.

    A CUSHION ABOVE THE SIGNAL (`entry_offset_pct`). The order reaches the
    broker ~3.5 minutes after the trigger bar closes, and these setups bounce
    fast: a limit AT the close only filled 91% on 538 setups replayed on
    1-minute bars, and the misses were net winners (META, LULU, SLB touched
    their limits and never filled). +0.30% filled 99% and earned the most
    total R, more than a market order, while still capping what is paid for a
    spike (limit_minute_test.py). Stop and target are unchanged.
