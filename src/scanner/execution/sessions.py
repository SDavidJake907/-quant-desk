"""Which US equity session is it? (WORKLIST §59)

Alpaca 24/5 (docs: 24/5 Trading): premarket 04:00-09:30 ET, regular 09:30-16:00,
after-hours 16:00-20:00, overnight 20:00-04:00 from Sunday evening to Friday
morning. Outside regular hours only LIMIT orders, time_in_force day/gtc,
extended_hours=true -- no stop or bracket orders.

`session_at` is PURE: give it the time and the broker's trading days (holidays
and weekends simply are not in the set). `current` asks the broker.
