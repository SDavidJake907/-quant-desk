"""The core-and-satellite plan (operator + Gemma, 2026-10-23): the rules, as numbers.

Operator: "selling at the top, and finding new stocks, or the same one, will also
create more profit". The account fell 2.5x the market Oct 2-22 (-3.2% vs SPY -1.3%);
none of the 71 positions sold in 30 days rose 5%+ afterwards -- the leak was buys and
churn (round trips of minutes). Drafted with the operator, agreed by Gemma with her
three additions (equal weight, max 2 per sector, a 10-day time stop), then three
trend gates, one per size group (operator: "gate1 big, gate2 mid, gate3 small").

  CORE       50% of the account in SPY, bought in two halves (no stop, never traded)
  SATELLITE  Gemma's 40%: 6 names, equal size (the per-name cap binds), max 2 a sector
  BUY        her group's gate open (SPY / MDY / IJR above its 200-day average), top
             third of her pool by 12-1 momentum, 6-month return up, above the 50-day,
             no earnings within 5 days; regular session only, from 10:00 ET; a name
             sold in the last 30 days only on a new 20-day closing high
  EXIT       stop 2.5 ATR under the buy (bought before WIDE_STOP_FROM: never more than 3% --
             profit_lock.loss_floor; from it, no cap and a smaller size, see same_risk_pct);
             from +1 ATR the stop is at least break-even; then a CLOSE under the
             highest close less 3 ATR sells; no fixed target; nothing reporting
             earnings is held into the report; no progress in 10 days sells; once a close
             was +5%, a close giving back half the best gain sells (the profit lock)
  HOLD       her own drops wait 3 trading days (stops, the loss limit and her
             sell-ifs from the day after the buy still act)

CHOSEN, not measured: graded monthly and quarterly against SPY. PURE.
