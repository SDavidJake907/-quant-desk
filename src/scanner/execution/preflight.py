"""Pre-flight checks that must pass before any scan or order path runs.

THE IDEA
A scan that starts with Ollama down, the embedding model missing, or the
broker unreachable is trading blind. For paper trading we degrade gracefully
(fail open, print loudly). For live trading the same conditions must hard-block:
a dead model must never become a silent halt, and a missing model environment
means the dedup and news gate that were measured with it are not the ones
running.

Every check here is read-only. None of them place an order, change a position,
or touch the audit log beyond recording their own result.
