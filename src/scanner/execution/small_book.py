"""The small-cap book: 10% of the account in up to 4 S&P SmallCap 600 names.

Operator 2026-10-27: "lets look into penny stocks.. low caps. and make a gate for it %10 of the
account"; chose S&P 600 members priced $5+, funded from the rules book, IWM above its 200-day as
the gate. The rules book's checks (satellite.buy_refusal: top-third 12-1 momentum within this pool,
6-month return up, above the 50-day, no earnings within the buffer, 2 a sector, the 30-day re-buy
rule) and its exits (plan_run.exit_pass with the full 2.5 ATR stop). `sml-` order ids.

CHOSEN, not measured: S&P 600 momentum beat random by +0.83 pts a 3-month hold, t 1.28, and lost
to it 2017-2020 (WORKLIST §31). Graded forward against IWM.

PURE: lists in, new lists out. scripts/small_pick.py does the reading and the queueing.
