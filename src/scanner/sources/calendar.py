"""Scheduled events that cause gaps.

WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER FILTER HERE
Seventeen signal filters were tested against this strategy and most made it
worse. This one is not a signal. It removes a KNOWN, DATED event from a
strategy whose measured weakness is precisely that event.

The evidence: gapped stops are the fat left tail. The five worst trades in the
study were all gaps — CF -3.56R, QCOM -2.78R, LITE -2.01R, UAL -1.60R,
MOS -1.58R — against a -1.00R mean for stops that filled normally. A position
sized to lose 1R lost 3.56R.

Earnings are the most predictable gap event that exists, and this strategy
holds overnight: only 54% of setups resolve inside one session. The news layer
reads what has already been published; it cannot know a company reports
tomorrow. This can.

SOURCE
Nasdaq's public calendar API — free, no key, verified returning 527 companies
for a single session. It is undocumented, so every failure is swallowed and
reported as "unknown" rather than "clear": a calendar outage must not silently
become permission to trade through earnings.
