"""What the President said, signed and is scheduled to do (WORKLIST §52).

Sources, each failing quietly to an empty tuple (a feed outage must never stop
the brief, and the brief says what it could not read):
  - Truth Social posts via the public trumpstruth.org RSS mirror -- THIRD-PARTY,
    labelled as such wherever it is shown.
  - whitehouse.gov RSS: presidential actions, briefings & statements, news.
  - The official public schedule as published by factba.se (usually only the
    day ahead: nobody publishes his moves weeks out).

Posts are kept IN FULL. A cut sentence once read "we will not be attacking
Iran at any ..." and was narrated as "at any time"; the post said "at any time
prior to the Midterm Elections".

Untrusted XML goes through defusedxml, as in yahoo_rss.
