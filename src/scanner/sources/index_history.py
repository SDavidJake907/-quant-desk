"""Point-in-time S&P index membership, reconstructed from Wikipedia change logs.

WHY THIS EXISTS
A backtest run over today's index members is not a backtest of the index. It
is a backtest of the companies that were good enough to still be in it — the
losers were deleted and are invisible. That is survivorship bias, and for a
momentum screen it flatters results specifically, because the names that
cratered hard enough to be dropped are exactly the ones a trend screen would
have been holding on the way down.

No amount of clever code fixes that. Only historical membership does.

COVERAGE
The S&P 500, MidCap 400 and SmallCap 600 pages share a table layout, so one
parser serves all three — 1,504 unique symbols with full GICS sectors. All
three reconstruct to within 2% of their fixed size back to 2021, measured by
`membership_drift`. Do not take that on trust for a new index: run the drift
audit, because a plausible-looking reconstruction is exactly what a subtly
broken parser produces (this one once "proved" the 400's log was unusable when
the real fault was unstripped cell attributes).

HOW IT WORKS
Each page carries two tables: today's members,
and a log of "AAA replaces BBB on <date>" changes. Membership on any past
date is today's list with every later change undone, newest first:

    added ticker   -> take it back out
    removed ticker -> put it back in

WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX

  1. The log is titled "SELECTED changes". It is dense from roughly 2000
     onward and sparse before that. `oldest_change` and `size_on` exist so
     callers can see where the reconstruction stops being trustworthy —
     a reconstructed year that drifts far from ~500 names is telling you the
     log has holes, not that the index shrank.

  2. Reconstruction gives you the ticker. It does not give you price history
     for it. Yahoo drops or reuses symbols of delisted companies, so some
     resurrected names will simply have no bars. Coverage that is worse for
     failed companies than for surviving ones is survivorship bias leaking
     back in through the data source — measure it, report it, do not assume
     it is small.

  3. Tickers are as-of-removal. A company that changed ticker before being
     deleted is recorded under the later one.
