"""Peak-sell readings for Gemma (operator, 2026-10-22).

The operator: sell at the high and take the profit. The rule uses only the indicators -- no dates,
days of the week or stock names ("stocks prices change, like today its at the lowest"). The six
checks are the pattern indicators show at a high, each threshold set a little LOWER than the
highest readings so it triggers just before the top.

NOT a tested edge -- an operator rule, logged in FREEZE.md. The code computes every reading; Gemma
sees them and decides; she can only sell a position that is in profit and scores at least MIN_MET.
